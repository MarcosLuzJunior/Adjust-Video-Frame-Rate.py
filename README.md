# Adjust-Video-Frame-Rate.py

This is a script that will:
- Ask the user for the new frames per second rate 
- Ask the user to point where the video is saved 
- Ask the user to point a directory to save the modified version of the video

It will then make a copy of each frame in the video using OpenCV, then append all the images into a variable and write it into a video using the specified frames per second rate
